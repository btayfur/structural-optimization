## How to Use This Repository

### Example Codes
The repository contains example code implementations in the `Code/Examples` directory. These examples demonstrate practical applications of optimization techniques covered in the course:

Each example includes source code, documentation, and sample results to help students understand the practical implementation of theoretical concepts. You can scan the QR codes (or just click) in the lecture notes to access specific examples directly from GitHub.


### Prerequisites to Edit Lecture Notes

To compile the LaTeX documents, you need:
- A LaTeX distribution (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX)
- A LaTeX editor (optional, but recommended)

### Compiling the Document

To generate the PDF from source:

1. Make sure you have a LaTeX distribution installed on your system
2. Compile the main.tex file with pdfLaTeX:
   ```
   pdflatex main.tex
   ```
3. Run the compilation multiple times to ensure proper cross-references and table of contents:
   ```
   pdflatex main.tex
   pdflatex main.tex
   ```

Alternatively, you can directly use the pre-compiled `main.pdf` file.
